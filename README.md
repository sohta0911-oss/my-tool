# Financial Engineering Self-Directed Study (2025-2028)

Welcome to my repository. I am an independent scholar dedicated to mastering the intersection of Finance and Mathematics. Starting in January 2025, I bypassed traditional academic curricula to build a self-directed, rigorous study path. My goal is to evolve into a **Financial Engineer** capable of contributing to global, small-scale high-impact projects by 2028.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap
- **2026 (Current)**: Obtain certifications in accounting, IT engineering, and statistics.
- **2027**: Conduct independent research through coding and publish results on GitHub.
- **2028**: Participate in hackathons and competitions → Gain hands-on experience.

## 📈 Featured Projects

### 1. AMD: Angular Momentum Difference
A proprietary technical indicator designed to quantify the "difference in momentum" between short-term and long-term trends.
- **Concept**: Calculates the difference in the angles of moving averages on a logarithmic scale.
$$\Delta \theta = \arctan(\text{MA}_{\text{short}}) - \arctan(\text{MA}_{\text{long}})$$
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Integrates an entropy-like function to adjust capital allocation based on signal strength.
$$f(x) = (cx) \ln(cx)$$
Where $x$ represents the signal strength and $c$ is a scaling constant.

### 2. Arbitrage Percentage Envelope (PPP Friction Model)
A macro-algorithmic approach to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) that accounts for real-world market frictions. The model identifies true arbitrage opportunities where price deviations exceed the sum of weighted friction constants.
$$\text{Opportunity} \iff |P_a - P_b \cdot E| > \sum_{i=1}^{n} \omega_i C_i$$
- **The "Three Frictions"**
  1. **Transportation Costs**: Physical movement of goods/people.
  2. **Transaction Costs**: Tariffs, insurance, and psychological/institutional barriers.
  3. **Information Asymmetry**: Time lags between opportunity recognition and execution.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy & Methodology
- **Generative AI as High-Leverage Tool**:I provide unique ideas and logical structures; AI assists in polishing implementations and linguistic precision.
- **Language Strategy**: Thinking logically in English, intuiting in Japanese.
- **2026 Focus**: Establishing a rigorous foundation in Mathematics and Economics.
- **Academic Milestone**: Preparing for the USCPA exam in 2026 to solidify accounting as the "language of business."
